This portfolio was made using:
    -REACT
    -HTML
    -CSS
    -EmailJS
    -Leafleat

The idea behind this personal project is to make one central hub that I can send people to to check out what I have to offer. I followed a tutorial and using all I know about web development to construct this website. I made it as flashy as possible with my current knowledge but as time goes by, I wanted a more simplistic portfolio so I might reduce this to one of my personal project only.
